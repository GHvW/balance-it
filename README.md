# balance-it
balance your check book that you totally still have and use

**WIP** - balance-it is a work in progress app. Created to play with Elm and mess around with new ideas

## Development
I'm using [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) for development

use `npm run dev` to get the dev server going

---

**Note**: Using `elm-live` from the command line instead of from npm, I had to run `elm-live src/Main.elm --start-page=index.html --hot --open -- -- --output=index.js` (with the extra `--`) to start the dev server
